    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* `threadIndexOverride` method overloads for `ParallelWriter.Add/TryAdd` operations for `NativeParallelHashMap`, `UnsafeParallelHashMap`, `NativeParallelHashSet`, `UnsafeParallelHashSet`, `NativeQueue`, `UnsafeQueue`, `NativeParallelMultiHashMap`, and `UnsafeParallelMultiHashMap`. These overloads allow some performance critical use-cases to sub-divide work that would previously be forced against a single collection, by enabling the (unsafe) injection of many instances of these collections (via their respective `ParallelWriter`s) into the same job. For example, this would allow you to convert a `NativeParallelMultiHashMap<Tuple<TIndex,TKey>,TValue>.ParallelWriter` pattern into an (unsafe) `NativeList<UnsafeParallelHashMap<TKey,TValue>.ParallelWriter>[TIndex]` pattern, which can; reduce individual collection capacities, reduce insertion/removal/clear call overheads, reduce the need to manually sort (or otherwise post-process) collection results, and allow better segmentation of work (i.e. higher granularity).\n\n### Changed\n\n* Updated Burst dependency to version 1.8.21\n\n### Fixed\n\n* UnsafeQueue memory leak due to OnDomainUnload callback being discarded by Burst.\n* Fixed incorrect error message when a NativeStream foreach index is out-of-range."
